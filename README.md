# Implementation of a forecast for (existing) records - exam project

The main part of this project should be to create a wheater forecast.
It should be possible to make statements about the wheater in different city's.
(You can choose every city you want!)

You can get information about temperature, sun, rain, wind and clouds of a choosen place.
After representing the forecast for the choosen city, the user should be asked if he/she would like to know the general forecast for a whole country too.
(For example - How is the weather in summer in the States?)

The implementation will be a console application.

For more information please look into the wiki. :-)
