# Implementation of a forecast for (existing) records

The main part of this project should be to create a wheater forecast.
It should be possible to make statements about the wheater in different city's, 
states (Bundesländer in Germany), countrys and special regions (e.g. rain forest, desert).

You can get information about temperature, sun, rain, wind and clouds of a choosen place.

After representing the forecast for e.g. a country, the user should be asked if he/she would like to know the forecast for a specific city too.

As an addition the user can also get information about the general weather of those places. (For example - How is the weather in summer in the States?)
