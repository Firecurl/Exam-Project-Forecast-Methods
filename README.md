# Implementation of a forecast for (existing) records - exam project

The main part of this project should be to create a wheater forecast.
It should be possible to make statements about the wheater in different city's, 
states (Bundesl√§nder in Germany), countrys and special regions (e.g. rain forest, desert).

You can get information about temperature, sun, rain, wind and clouds of a choosen place.
After representing the forecast for e.g. a country, the user should be asked if he/she would like to know the forecast for a specific city too.
As an addition the user can also get information about the general weather of those places. (For example - How is the weather in summer in the States?)

The implementation will be a console application.
